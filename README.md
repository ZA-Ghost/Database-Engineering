# Database Engineering Projects

Welcome to my database engineering repository. This project space revolves around real-world inspired solutions built for a fictional client: **Van de Merwe** — a demanding client with complex, ever-evolving data needs.

## Meet Van de Merwe

Van de Merwe runs a growing organization with chaotic data streams, inconsistent records, outdated spreadsheets, and critical business decisions waiting on accurate reports. He doesn’t know the difference between a primary key and a coffee key — but he knows he needs results.

That’s where I come in.

## My Role

As Van de Merwe’s trusted **Database Engineer**, I am responsible for everything related to data:

- **Designing scalable database architectures**
- **Optimizing slow queries**
- **Creating stored procedures and triggers**
- **Securing data access**
- **Providing insightful reports**
- **Disaster recovery planning**

If it touches data, I do it.

| "We need weekly sales summaries emailed to HR"   | Create scheduled ETL jobs and formatted reports           |
| "Our data is wrong again!"                       | Trace issue, validate data integrity, apply constraints   |
| "Can I see revenue by branch, quarter and product?" | Write grouped queries with filters and generate a view  |
| "Oops, we lost yesterday’s data!"                | Restore from backups and review recovery strategy         |

## Why This Matters

Van de Merwe relies on **clean, efficient, secure, and scalable** data solutions to run his business. My role is to ensure the data works silently and powerfully in the background — no delays, no corruption, no noise.
